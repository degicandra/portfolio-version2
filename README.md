# Portfolio Website (React + Vite)

Quick scaffold for a single-page, dark, animated portfolio (landing / about / experience / projects / contact) with a 2/5 sidebar.

Run locally:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Notes:
- Sidebar occupies ~40% width on desktop and collapses for small screens.
- Scroll is smooth; clicking sidebar items scrolls to sections.
- Animations use AOS and small CSS keyframes.
- Customize `src/data/projects.js`, `src/index.css`, and `src/App.jsx` to add content or tweak styles.
